                <h2>Your guide</h2>
                <p>My name is Ginbie Abebe. I am an official tour guide for the Simien mountains national park. I grew up right here in Debark and I have worked for the national park as independent tour guide in the mountains for the last 5 years. Before this, I studied and graduated from Gondar university in geography and then worked as a teacher for three years. I've lead many treks with people from all over the world! Among other things, I am trained on and am knowledgeable about the following:
                <li>Birds</li>
                <li>Mamals</li>
                <li>Plants</li>
                <li>Trekking arrangements</li>
                <li>Ethiopian history</li>
                <li>Guiding techniques</li>
                <li>First aid</li></p>
                <p>I take customer service very seriously but my clients tell me that I have a good sense of humor as well! I love to show visitors the spectacular scenery of my home and to provide answers to questions about our endemic species and about Ethiopia in general.</p>
                <p>Aside from being a tour guide, I am also a runner and I have competed in Ethiopia for 6 years. I've won 12km and 21km (half marathon) races many times in Gondar, Bahirdar and Addis Ababa. I want to go to a much higher level of running than I am right now. I dedicate a lot of my time to becoming a faster runner when I am not running (no pun intended) my business. I am currently training with a small running club here in the Simien mountains.</p>

                <h3>What will I be eating each day?</h3>
                <p>You have your own personal chef and can make food requests for the trip! Expect eggs for breakfast and a 3 course meal for dinner... everything from lamb to pasta and homemade soup.</p>
                <h3>How far will I be walking each day?</h3>
                <p>This depends on your level of fitness but we aim to do about 6-8 hours of walking a day (up to 8 miles), depending on your level of fitness.</p>

                <h2>Testimonials</h2>
                <q>I visited the Simien mountains in November 2015 and had the trip of a lifetime! The mountains were beautiful and Ginbe helped to make the trip fun and informative. Ginbe went beyond the call of duty when I had some issues with another agent and I will always be grateful to him for that! I thoroughly recommend booking a trip now - whatever your level of fitness, the hike is not to be missed</q><p>Lucinda (UK)</p>
                <!-- TODO add name/age/location <q>Trekking with Ginbie up through the Simien mountains was one of the most amazing experiences. He was such a lovely guide, so smart, so helpful and knowledgable. The whole trek was very well organised, the food was delicious and the nights were comfortable with a great atmosphere. I would highly recommend it.</q><p></p> -->
                <q>My wife &amp; I just returned from 9 days trekking in the Simien Moutains with Ginbie's company. Ginbie is a great guide, entirely trustworthy &amp; very experienced. Our team of Scout, cook, cook's assistant &amp; mule driver (plus mule-named tucka!) were all excellent. We were made comfortable at all times &amp; the food was excellent. We saw Gelada Baboons, Wallia Ibex &amp; Klipspringer en route and of course many birds. Wonderful! The sections of the walk that follow the edge of the escarpment &amp; the 2,000 metre cliffs are spectacular. Other highlights were the climb of Ras Dejen (4,800m +) and visiting the JICA Project at Ambaras village where we were shown Injera making, Coffee ceremony &amp; Beer making. We can honestly recommend Ginbie's company to you without reservation.</q><p>John (UK) &amp; Chie (Japan)</p>
